    "# Fake News Project\n",
    "### Authors: Jurat - Aldo\n",
    "In this project, we want to investigate the problem of fake news from the NLP point of view. The idea is to perform an analysis of fake and genuine news in search of some linguistic patterns that might lead us to better understand the underlying phenomena that eventually could help to improve the detection of fake news. It is well known that manipulating information can have a negative impact on critical issues in society. Hence, detecting fake news is an urgent problem to be tackled. As part of the project, we are going to focus on a specific subgroup of fake news among celebrities, political debates, political issues, economy, education, technology, sexual misconduct, hoaxes and others."
